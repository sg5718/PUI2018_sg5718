- Peers' Reviews:
1. As aaw329 and ys3226 both suggested, I added the unit (gallon) for y-axis.
2. According to aaw329's recommendation that compare specific years by matching points to a location on the x-axis or horizontal lines with water consumption, this is a good idea for further detailed analysis. After all, the dataset I used is about the macro-change of the amount of the water consumption from 1979 to 2017 in New York City.
3. According to ys3226's recommendation that specify the water consumption type, this is also a good idea for further detailed analysis. However, I am lack of this relating data.
4. In order to convey the information I find from this dataset more clearly, I added one more scatter plot about the change of population from 1979 to 2017 in New York City.
5. In order to make the Water consumption vs Year plot more readable, I drew a bar chart and annotated the amount of water consumption in each year.
