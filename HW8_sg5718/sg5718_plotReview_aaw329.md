The plot clearly shows that per capita water usage has gone down, but the y-axis has no units so I would recommend adding “in gallons” or something similar. While not necessary to convey your point, it might be nice to have vertical lines in the plot if you’d like the reader to be able to compare specific years by matching points to a location on the x-axis, and/or horizontal lines if you wanted to do the same with water consumption.

One solid color choice is good for the data points (blue is appropriate!), and everything is readable. The plot is a little blurry, however, and making it crisper would improve the overall readability/aesthetic.
